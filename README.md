# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately determine the presence of heart disease in patients based on a set of medical attributes. This model aims to assist in early diagnosis and potential intervention, improving patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.

## Dataset
This project utilizes the **Heart Disease dataset** from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**. The dataset contains multiple medical attributes, such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other health indicators, which will be analyzed to predict heart disease.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The programming language used for data analysis and model building.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and model development.
- **Libraries**:
  - `numpy` and `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `sklearn.model_selection` for splitting the dataset into training and test sets.
  - `sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` for building the predictive model.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset and handle missing values.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions.
   - Normalize and scale necessary features.
2. **Model Development**:
   - Split the dataset into training and test sets.
   - Implement Logistic Regression as the predictive model.
   - Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
3. **Results Interpretation**:
   - Assess model performance and interpret findings.
   - Provide insights on the most important medical attributes affecting heart disease prediction.
